# Java App Seed

This is an application seed to quickly get started with containerized Java application development using GitHub Codespaces.

## Features

Application

- Spring Boot Web API project with tests
- Wired for integration with external observability solutions via Prometheus metrics
- Ready for container development with a multistage `Dockerfile`

Inner loop development

- Preconfigured VS Code environment
  - Ready for `F5` debugging
  - Tasks for `Build`, `Run`, and `Test`
  - Curated extensions

> Note: You may see a message that your application is ready and running on port 8081, but it will not be available until the postCreate script completes execution.

![Post Create](docs/post-create.png)

Container inner loop

- Local k8s development cluster
- The `Run in local cluster` VS Code task
  - builds your image
  - launches your app inside your local cluster
  - configures a route to access your app
- `Reset local cluster` can teardown and bring your local cluster

### (optional) Kubernetes development

If you'd like to opt-in to a k8s-aware development experience

- Use the provided `Enable k8s development` task to
  - Configure VS Code with additional extensions
  - Launch [Octant](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant) to interact with your local cluster in a web interface (forwarded port `7777`)
- In the terminal, `kubectl` is available and pointed at your local cluster

## Getting Started

[Use this template](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-api-template/generate) to create a new repository

![Use this template](docs/use-this-template.png)

In your repository, create a new Codespace

![New codespace](docs/new-codespace.png)

### Application Development

After the Codespace is created, your development environment is ready to go! Try some of the following tasks:

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build your app
- Hit `F5` to start debugging
- Run your app
  - Open `Tasks: Run Task` (press `Ctrl+Shift+P`), type and select `Tasks: Run Task`, then `Run` to launch your app in watch mode
  - Now, from `Tasks: Run Task`, select `Open Port in Browser` and choose port `5000` to visit your running app
    - `/healthcheck`: confirm the service is up and *Healthy*
    - `/metrics`: view the metrics configured to be scraped by Prometheus    

### Container Development

Your Codespace has a preconfigured running cluster so that you can validate how your application will behave when deployed

- From `Tasks: Run Task` (press `Ctrl+Shift+P`), select `Run in local cluster`. Your app will load in a new browser tab.
- To reset the local cluster for any reason, you can use the `Reset local cluster` task

Your Codespace also has a local portal that exposes a number of services that will also be present when your app is deployed

- Using `Tasks: Run Task`, select `Launch Platform Portal in New Tab`
- The application increments a metric named `hits` each time the "Hello, World!" path is used. From the portal, use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to query app metrics
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is also available for visualization. The instance is local to your Codespace with the following settings:
  - A `Sample Dashboard` to see the `api_hits_total` counter (Navigate to the 'General' folder to see the link)
- [Fluentbit](https://fluentbit.io/) is configured to scrape the application and Kubernetes logs and can be accessed from the portal. The application does not log requests by default. The log level can be set in `src/main/resources/application.properties` or by using environment variables. For information on setting the log levels, see [Spring Boot docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.5/reference/htmlsingle/#features.logging.log-levels)

> You can also view the list of [forwarded ports](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace) available to your Codespace in the `PORTS` tab in the Integrated Terminal


### Configuring a different Container Registry

This environment comes with github actions to build and push the application containers to the GitHub container registry.

If you wish, you can configure the repo to use the container registry of your choice by [creating the following secrets in the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL
- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER
- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN

These values can be obtained from your specific container registry provider.

> **Note**
>
> To return to the default, simply remove the secrets from the repository.

## Application Deployment

The process of deploying an application is dependent on the team that manages the platform. This team makes application templates available. These templates describe the
configuration values that are required for the deployoment.

The team will require the creation of a properly configured ```app.yaml``` file.

A sample of this file exists in the root of this repo.
